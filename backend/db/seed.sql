'<h1>Australian Chiropractors – Your Health and Wellbeing Matters</h1>
<p><strong>Tuesday 01, Oct 2024</strong></p>

<p>This is an opportunity to participate in the first-ever survey on the mental health and well-being of Australian chiropractors and chiropractic students. The outcomes will provide the framework to help the profession mitigate the risks of clinician burnout and give deeper insight into professional satisfaction and attrition.</p>

<p>The mental health and well-being of health professionals are crucial for maintaining an effective workforce. While many health professions routinely screen and assess the mental health of their members, the chiropractic profession in Australia has yet to implement such practices. To address this gap, a standardised and validated survey has been developed as part of a global initiative aimed at understanding the mental health and wellbeing of chiropractors. This survey will gather valuable information about the chiropractic profession and serve as a foundation for creating chiropractic-specific mental health resources.</p>

<p>It is essential that every Australian chiropractor and chiropractic student has the opportunity to participate, as the anonymous survey will be available for completion from October 2024 to January 2025.</p>
